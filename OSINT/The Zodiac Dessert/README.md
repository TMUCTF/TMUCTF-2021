Well You should only have selected the murder site near San Francisco botanical garden. Then searching for "cafe" in google maps would result in Cafe Bunn Mi on the Clement St.
Googling the cafe menu you could find it on many websites like:
[https://www.zmenu.com/cafe-bunn-mi-san-francisco-online-menu/](https://www.zmenu.com/cafe-bunn-mi-san-francisco-online-menu/).
In the menu there was a 4$ dessert named French Coffee Flan.

The flag:
